However, just because a virus is detectable does not mean it poses a health risk. So an interesting related question is: How long should we worry about becoming sick from touching a contaminated surface? The answer to this is probably shorter than three to nine days. One reason is that the virus concentration on surfaces declines over time as it dries out, so the longer the time since contamination, the lower the risk. A second reason is that only a portion of the total virus will transfer from the surface to your hand to your mouth or nose.
